    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:16

    If true, IS_CAST_DEBUG_BUILD() will evaluate to 1 in version.h. Otherwise,
    it will evaluate to 0. Overriding this when is_debug=false is useful for
    doing engineering builds.

    clang_use_default_sample_profile is true and clang_sample_profile_path is
    empty.

chromeos_is_browser_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/ui_mode.gni:11

    This controls UI configuration for Chrome.
    If this flag is set, we assume Chrome runs on Chrome OS devices, using
    Wayland (instead of X11).
    TODO(crbug.com/1052397): After the clean up, this should be
    replaced with 'target_os = "chromeos" && ui_mode == "browser"'.

    containing an integer that's a unix timestamp in UTC.
    This timestamp is used as build time and will be compiled into
    other code.
   
    This argument may look unused. Before removing please check with the
    chromecast team to see if they still use it internally.

compute_inputs_for_analyze
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compute_inputs_for_analyze.gni:13

    Enable this flag when running "gn analyze".
   
    This causes some gn actions to compute inputs immediately (via exec_script)
    where they would normally compute them only when executed (and write them to
    a depfile).
   
    This flag will slow down GN, but is required for analyze to work properly.

concurrent_links
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/toolchain/concurrent_links.gni:21

    Limit the number of concurrent links; we often want to run fewer
    links at once than we do compiles, because linking is memory-intensive.
    The default to use varies by platform and by the amount of memory
    available, so we call out to a script to get the right value.

    The path to the coverage instrumentation input file should be a source root
    absolute path (e.g. //out/Release/coverage_instrumentation_input.txt), and
    the file consists of multiple lines where each line represents a path to a
    source file, and the paths must be relative to the root build directory.
    e.g. ../../base/task/post_task.cc for build directory 'out/Release'.
   
    NOTE that this arg will be non-op if use_clang_coverage is false.

cppgc_enable_caged_heap
    Current value (from the default) = true

    standalone to produce static libraries to use in their projects.

dawn_enable_cross_reflection
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/dawn/scripts/dawn_features.gni:63

    Enable use of reflection compiler in spirv-cross. This is needed
    if performing reflection on systems that the platform language
    shader is SPIR-V, since there isn't an instance of the
    GLSL/HLSL/MSL compiler. This implicitly pulls in the GLSL
    compiler, since it is a sub-class of it.

dawn_enable_d3d12
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/dawn/scripts/dawn_features.gni:41

    Enables the compilation of Dawn's D3D12 backend

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/dawn/scripts/dawn_features.gni:83

dawn_enable_wgsl
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/dawn/scripts/dawn_features.gni:74

    Enable support WGSL for shaders.
    Turned off for Skia, because Tint is currently not part of its DEPS.

dawn_use_swiftshader
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/dawn/scripts/dawn_features.gni:28

    Enables usage of swiftshader on the Vulkan backend.
    Note that this will only work in standalone and in projects that set the
    dawn_swiftshader_dir variable in build_overrides/dawn.gni
    Because of how the Vulkan loader works, setting this makes Dawn only able
    to find the Swiftshader ICD and not the others.
    Enabled by default when fuzzing.

dawn_use_x11
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/dawn/scripts/dawn_features.gni:70

enable_additional_blink_object_names
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/public/public_features.gni:21

    If enable_additional_blink_object_names is set to true, then blink provides
    additional debug names of blink-internal (i.e. oilpan) object names at the
    cost of additional memory. Many of these objects only show up in heap
    snapshots if the parameter `treatGlobalObjectsAsRoots` of `takeHeapSnapshot`
    is set.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:45

    Controls inclusion of code for ARCore that must be identical across configs.
    Once crbug.com/920424 is resolved, this will exactly control whether ARCore
    is supported.
    TODO(crbug.com/843374): AR should not depend on |enable_vr|.

enable_assistant_integration_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromeos/assistant/assistant.gni:18

    Enable Assistant integration tests using LibAssistant and a fake S3 server.
    This requires libassistant.so to support grpc communication with the S3
    server, which increases the library size, which is why we introduced this
    flag to disable them in the release builds.

enable_background_mode
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:34

enable_base_tracing
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:22

    Tracing support requires //third_party/perfetto, which is not available in
    libchrome (CrOS's version of //base). This flag can disable tracing support
    altogether, in which case all tracing instrumentation in //base becomes a
    no-op.
    TODO(crbug/1065905): Add dependency on perfetto to support typed events.

enable_basic_print_dialog
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:38

enable_downstream_media_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/test/media_router/BUILD.gn:10

    Many of the targets defined in this file have dependencies that cannot be
    satisfied without additional downstream resources. Explicitly guard them
    them behind this flag so that we do not attempt to build or isolate targets
    in public chromium checkouts.

enable_dsyms
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/mac/symbols.gni:17

    Produce dSYM files for targets that are configured to do so. dSYM
    generation is controlled globally as it is a linker output (produced via
    the //build/toolchain/mac/linker_driver.py. Enabling this will result in
    all shared library, loadable module, and executable targets having a dSYM
    generated.

enable_extensions
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //extensions/buildflags/buildflags.gni:8

enable_fake_assistant_microphone
    Current value (from the default) = false

      From //components/feed/features.gni:9

enable_ffmpeg_video_decoders
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:143

    On Android, FFMpeg is built without video decoders by default.
    This flag gives the option to override that decision in case there are no
    hardware decoders. To do so, you will also need to update ffmpeg build files
    in order to define which decoders to build in.

enable_full_stack_frames_for_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:56

    Compile in such a way as to make it possible for the profiler to unwind full
    stack frames. Setting this flag has a large effect on the performance of the
    generated code than just setting profiling, but gives the profiler more
    information to analyze.
    Requires profiling to be set to true.

enable_google_benchmarks
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/google_benchmark/buildconfig.gni:11

    Google Benchmark is not checked out by default, because it is only used by
    a few specialized benchmarks that most developers do not interact with.

      From //tools/ipc_fuzzer/ipc_fuzzer.gni:15

enable_ipc_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ipc/features.gni:7

    Enabling debug builds automatically sets enable_ipc_logging to true.

enable_iterator_debugging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:41

    When set, enables libc++ debug mode with iterator debugging.
   
    Iterator debugging is generally useful for catching bugs. But it can
    introduce extra locking to check the state of an iterator against the state
    of the current object. For iterator- and thread-heavy code, this can
    significantly slow execution - two orders of magnitude slowdown has been
    seen (crbug.com/903553) and iterator debugging also slows builds by making
    generation of snapshot_blob.bin take ~40-60 s longer. Therefore this
    defaults to off.

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/closure_compiler/compile_js.gni:11

    Enable closure type-checking for Chrome's web technology-based UI. This

      From //media/media_options.gni:93

    Enable browser managed persistent metadata storage for EME persistent
    session and persistent usage record session.

enable_media_remoting
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:242

    This switch defines whether the Media Remoting implementation will be built.
    When enabled, media is allowed to be renderer and played back on remote
    devices when the tab is being casted and other conditions are met.

enable_media_remoting_rpc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:248

    Media Remoting RPC is disabled on Android since it's unused but increases
    the native binary size by ~70Kb.

      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:43

    Enables Closure compilation of generated JS lite bindings. In environments
    where compilation is supported, any mojom target "foo" will also have a
    corresponding "foo_js_library_for_compile" target generated.

enable_mojom_fuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:50

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:32

    Indicates whether typemapping should be supported in this build
    configuration. This may be disabled when building external projects which
    depend on //mojo but which do not need/want all of the Chromium tree
    dependencies that come with typemapping.
   
    Note that (perhaps obviously) a huge amount of Chromium code will not build
    with typemapping disabled, so it is never valid to set this to |false| in
    any Chromium build configuration.

enable_mse_mpeg2ts_stream_parser
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:72

enable_mutex_priority_inheritance

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/buildflags_paint_preview.gni:15

    Enable basic paint preview support. Does not work on iOS or Fuchsia. Should
    not be included with Chromecast. Not ready for shipping builds yet so
    include in unofficial builds.
    Used by //components/paint_preview and //third_party/harfbuzz-ng.
    TODO(bug/webrtc:11223) Move back this file in //components/paint_preview/

enable_perfetto_ipc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:142

    Allow the embedder to use the IPC layer. In turn this allows to use the
    system backend in the client library.
    This includes building things that rely on POSIX sockets, this places
    limitations on the supported operating systems.

      From //components/printing/browser/BUILD.gn:14

    Enable print media localization only on the platforms that support CUPS IPP
    (ChromeOS and macOS for now). The localization expects media vendor IDs
    uniquely generated by CUPS IPP.

enable_print_preview
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:18

    Enable printing with print preview. It implies enable_basic_printing.
    Note: It would be convenient to not repeat many of the same conditions in
    enable_basic_printing below. However, GN does not allow the use of
    enable_basic_printing within the same declare_args() block.

enable_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:49

    Compile in such a way as to enable profiling of the generated code. For
    example, don't omit the frame pointer and leave in symbols.

enable_qr_print
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/qr_code_generator/BUILD.gn:7

    Enables building a development / debugging binary.

enable_random_mojo_delays
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //mojo/public/cpp/bindings/BUILD.gn:17

    enable_random_mojo_delays starts a task runner that periodically pauses
    random Mojo bindings and later resumes them, in order to test whether parts
    of the code implicitly rely on FIFO processing of messages sent on different
    message pipes (which they should not).

enable_reading_list
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //components/reading_list/features/reading_list.gni:8

    Controls whether reading list support is active or not. Currently only
    supported on iOS (on other platforms, the feature is always disabled).

enable_remoting
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //remoting/remoting_enable.gni:12

enable_reporting
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:29

    Reporting not used on iOS.

enable_resource_whitelist_generation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/gcc_toolchain.gni:27

enable_runtime_media_renderer_selection
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:161

    When enabled, this feature allows developers to use a runtime flag to
    choose the implementation of the renderer that is used. On a build which
    enables the mojo renderer, if --disable-mojo-renderer is passed at start-up,
    the "default" renderer will be used instead. Both renderer implementations
    will be linked if this feature is enabled, increasing the binary size. This
    feature does not make sense if the mojo renderer is not enabled.

enable_segment_heap
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/manifest.gni:46

enable_service_discovery
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:54

enable_session_service
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:58

    Enables use of the session service, which is enabled by default.
    Android stores them separately on the Java side.

enable_skia_dawn_gtests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //skia/features.gni:13

    Enable gtests using SkiaRenderer Dawn.
    TODO(sgilhuly): Remove this and enable the tests by default once a software
    path for D3D12 is available.

enable_skia_wuffs_gif
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //skia/BUILD.gn:37

enable_snap_package
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/installer/linux/BUILD.gn:27

    Enable building snap packages

enable_soda
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/services/speech/buildflags.gni:6

enable_stripping
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/mac/symbols.gni:24

    Strip symbols from linked targets by default. If this is enabled, the
    //build/config/mac:strip_all config will be applied to all linked targets.
    If custom stripping parameters are required, remove that config from a
    linked target and apply custom -Wcrl,strip flags. See
    //build/toolchain/mac/linker_driver.py for more information.

enable_supervised_users
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:60

enable_swiftshader
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/gl/features.gni:24

enable_swiftshader_vulkan
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //gpu/vulkan/features.gni:16

    Enable swiftshader vulkan. Disabling it can save build time, however
    --use-vulkan=swiftshader and some tests which use swiftshader vulkan will
    not work.

enable_tab_search
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/webui/webui_features.gni:20

    Enable tab search only on a branded desktop build.
    In order to get commit queue coverage for C++ tests,
    this flag only gates the html/js webui resources, not the C++
    files

enable_tagged_pdf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:21

    Enable exporting to tagged PDF.

enable_trace_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/openscreen/src/util/BUILD.gn:11

    Enables trace logging in build. This is true by default, unless
    we are built against Chrome--we have no way to link their platform
    implementation into our binaries so trace logging is not possible.

enable_typescript_bindings
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:46

    Enables generating Typescript bindings and compiling them to JS bindings.

enable_vr
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:31

    Enable VR device support whenever VR device SDK(s) are supported.
    We enable VR on Linux even though VR features aren't usable because
    the binary size impact is small and allows many VR tests to run on Linux

enable_vulkan
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //gpu/vulkan/features.gni:11

    Enable experimental vulkan backend.

enable_wayland_server
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:63

    Indicates if Wayland display server support is enabled.

enable_websockets
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:13

    WebSockets and socket stream code are not used on iOS and are optional in
    cronet.

enable_webui_tab_strip
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/webui/webui_features.gni:14

    Enable the WebUI version of the browser's tab strip.

enable_widevine
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/widevine/cdm/widevine.gni:13

    Enables Widevine key system support. Enabled by default in Google Chrome,
    on Android and Fuchsia platforms.
    Can be optionally enabled in Chromium on non-Android platforms. Please see
    //src/third_party/widevine/LICENSE file for details.

enable_widevine_cdm_host_verification
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/widevine/cdm/widevine.gni:58

enable_wifi_display
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //extensions/buildflags/buildflags.gni:12

    Enables Wi-Fi Display functionality
    WARNING: This enables MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG-TS) encoding!

enable_windows_mr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:15

enable_wmax_tokens
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:143

exclude_unwind_tables
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:98

    Exclude unwind tables by default for official builds as unwinding can be
    done from stack dumps produced by Crashpad at a later time "offline" in the
    crash server. Since this increases binary size, we don't recommend including
    them in shipping builds.
    For unofficial (e.g. development) builds and non-Chrome branded (e.g. Cronet
    which doesn't use Crashpad, crbug.com/479283) builds it's useful to be able
    to unwind at runtime.

fatal_linker_warnings
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:64

    Enable fatal linker warnings. Building Chromium with certain versions
    of binutils can cause linker warning.

ffmpeg_branding
    Current value (from the default) = "Chromium"
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:34

    Controls whether we build the Chromium or Google Chrome version of FFmpeg.
    The Google Chrome version contains additional codecs. Typical values are
    Chromium, Chrome, and ChromeOS.

ffmpeg_use_atomics_fallback
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:51

    Set to true to force the use of ffmpeg's stdatomic fallback code.
   
    Windows and GCC prior to 4.9 lack stdatomic.h.
   
    This is also useful for developers who use icecc, which relies upon
    clang's -frewrite-includes flag which is broken with #include_next
    directives as used in chromium's clang stdatomic.h.
    Some background: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26828

fieldtrial_testing_like_official_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/variations/service/BUILD.gn:14

    Set to true make a build that disables activation of field trial tests
    specified in testing/variations/fieldtrial_testing_config.json.
    Note: this setting is ignored if is_chrome_branded.
    TODO(thakis): It's strange this is called "_like_official_build" but then
    checks is_chrome_branded, not is_official_build.

forbid_non_component_debug_builds
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:89

    Whether an error should be raised on attempts to make debug builds with
    is_component_build=false. Very large debug symbols can have unwanted side
    effects so this is enforced by default for chromium.

force_build_standalone_receiver
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/openscreen/src/BUILD.gn:13

    Set to true to force building the standalone receiver on Mac. It's currently
    disabled due to build bot struggles, but works fine on local, recent clang
    installations.
    TODO(crbug.com/openscreen/86): Remove when the Mac bots have been upgraded.

from_here_uses_location_builtins
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:62

    Whether or not the FROM_HERE macro uses base::Location::Current(). This
    allows the implementation to be reverted if needed while validating its
    replacement base::Location::Current(). On by default in non-official builds
    for testing purposes.
    TODO(https://crbug.com/974061): remove this eventually.

gcc_target_rpath
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/gcc/BUILD.gn:19

    When non empty, overrides the target rpath value. This allows a user to
    make a Chromium build where binaries and shared libraries are meant to be
    installed into separate directories, like /usr/bin/chromium and
    /usr/lib/chromium for instance. It is useful when a build system that
    generates a whole target root filesystem (like Yocto) is used on top of gn,
    especially when cross-compiling.
    Note: this gn arg is similar to gyp target_rpath generator flag.

generate_linker_map
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:26

    Used for binary size analysis.

generate_order_files
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:13

    Turn this on to generate order files. See
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/win_order_files.md

gold_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:60

    When we are going to use gold we need to find it.
    This is initialized below, after use_gold might have been overridden.

goma_dir
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:17

    Absolute directory containing the gomacc binary.

google_api_key
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:48

    Set these to bake the specified API keys and OAuth client
    IDs/secrets into your build.
   
    If you create a build without values baked in, you can instead
    set environment variables to provide the keys at runtime (see
    src/google_apis/google_api_keys.h for details).  Features that
    require server-side APIs may fail to work if no keys are
    provided.
   
    Note that if you are building an official build or if
    use_official_google_api_keys has been set to trie (explicitly or
    implicitly), these values will be ignored and the official
    keys will be used instead.

google_default_client_id
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:51

    See google_api_key.

google_default_client_secret
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:54

    See google_api_key.

gtest_enable_absl_printers
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:32

    Allows googletest to pretty-print various absl types.  Disabled for nacl due
    to lack of toolchain support.

gtk_version
    Current value (from the default) = 3
      From //build/config/linux/gtk/gtk.gni:12

    The (major) version of GTK to build against.

has_native_accessibility
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/base/ui_features.gni:12

    Whether the platform provides a native accessibility toolkit.

headless_fontconfig_utils
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //headless/headless.gni:10

    Provide bindings for font loading for headless embedders.

headless_use_embedded_resources
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //headless/headless.gni:7

    Embed resource.pak file into the binary for easier distribution.

host_byteorder
    Current value (from the default) = "undefined"
      From //build/config/host_byteorder.gni:9

host_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_cpu`.)

host_os
    Current value (from the default) = "linux"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_os`.)

host_pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:36

    A optional pkg-config wrapper to use for tools built on the host.

host_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:148

    This should not normally be set as a build argument.  It's here so that
    every toolchain can pass through the "global" value via toolchain_args().

icu_disable_thin_archive
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:11

    If true, compile icu into a standalone static library. Currently this is
    only useful on Chrome OS.

icu_use_data_file
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:8

    Tells icu to load an external data file rather than rely on the icudata
    being linked directly into the binary.

ignore_elf32_limitations
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:53

    Android 32-bit non-component, non-clang builds cannot have symbol_level=2
    due to 4GiB file size limit, see https://crbug.com/648948.
    Set this flag to true to skip the assertion.

include_transport_security_state_preload_list
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:37

    Includes the transport security state preload list. This list includes
    mechanisms (e.g. HSTS, HPKP) to enforce trusted connections to a significant
    set of hardcoded domains. While this list has a several hundred KB of binary
    size footprint, this flag should not be disabled unless the embedder is
    willing to take the responsibility to make sure that all important
    connections use HTTPS.

include_vr_data
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:37

    Whether to include VR extras like test APKs in non-VR-specific targets

init_stack_vars
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:128

    Initialize all local variables with a pattern. This flag will fill
    uninitialized floating-point types (and 32-bit pointers) with 0xFF and the
    rest with 0xAA. This makes behavior of uninitialized memory bugs consistent,
    recognizeble in debugger, and crashes memory accesses by uninitialized
    pointers.
    TODO(vitalybuka):
    'is_android' breaks content_shell_test_apk on android-kitkat-arm-rel.
    'use_xcode_clang' may call old clang.

internal_gles2_conform_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/gles2_conform_support/BUILD.gn:7

    Set to true to compile with the OpenGL ES 2.0 conformance tests.

internal_khronos_glcts_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/khronos_glcts_support/BUILD.gn:8

invert_fieldtrials
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/variations/field_trial_config/BUILD.gn:6

ios_deployment_target
    Current value (from the default) = "12.0"
      From //build/config/ios/ios_sdk_overrides.gni:10

    Version of iOS that we're targeting.

ios_use_goma_rbe
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:30

    Auto-configure for Goma RBE backend.
    TODO(crbug.com/1015730): true if use_goma = true in the future.

is_asan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:13

    Compile for Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs.

is_cast_audio_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:23

    Set this true for an audio-only Chromecast build.

is_cast_desktop_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:42

    True if Chromecast build is targeted for linux desktop. This type of build
    is useful for testing and development, but currently supports only a subset
    of Cast functionality. Though this defaults to true for x86 Linux devices,
    this should be overriden manually for an embedded x86 build.
    TODO(slan): Remove instances of this when x86 is a fully supported platform.

is_cfi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:58

    Compile with Control Flow Integrity to protect virtual calls and casts.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html
   
    TODO(pcc): Remove this flag if/when CFI is enabled in all official builds.
   
    Disable this on linux-chromeos to avoid using ThinLTO there;
    crbug.com/1033839. Similarly, don't use this on ARC builds.

is_cfm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromeos/services/cfm/public/buildflags/buildflags.gni:7

    True if compiling for Chromebox for Meeting devices.

is_chrome_branded
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:9

    Select the desired branding flavor. False means normal Chromium branding,
    true means official Google Chrome branding (requires extra Google-internal
    resources).

is_chromecast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:11

    Set this true for a Chromecast build. Chromecast builds are supported on
    Linux and Android.

is_chromeos_device
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:26

    Determines if we're building for a Chrome OS device (or VM) and not just
    linux-chromeos. NOTE: Most test targets in Chrome expect to run under
    linux-chromeos, so some have compile-time asserts that intentionally fail
    when this build flag is set. Build and run the tests for linux-chromeos
    instead.
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/chromeos_build_instructions.md
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/simple_chrome_workflow.md

is_clang
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:137

    Set to true when compiling with the Clang compiler.

is_component_build
    Current value = false
      From //out/stable86_Release_Single_Cronet/args.gn:4
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:165

    Component build. Setting to true compiles targets declared as "components"
    as shared libraries loaded dynamically. This speeds up development time.
    When false, components will be linked statically.
   
    For more information see
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/component_build.md

is_component_ffmpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:41

    Set true to build ffmpeg as a shared library. NOTE: this means we should
    always consult is_component_ffmpeg instead of is_component_build for
    ffmpeg targets. This helps linux chromium packagers that swap out our
    ffmpeg.so with their own. See discussion here
    https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-packagers/R5rcZXWxBEQ/B6k0zzmJbvcJ

is_ct_supported
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //services/network/public/cpp/features.gni:10

    Certificate transparency is not supported on iOS.
    TODO(mmenke): It's actually not supported on Android, either.

is_debug
    Current value = false
      From //out/stable86_Release_Single_Cronet/args.gn:3
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:155

    Debug build. Enabling official builds automatically sets is_debug to false.

is_desktop_linux
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:134

    Whether we're a traditional desktop unix.

is_ggp
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:8

is_hwasan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:18

    Compile for Hardware-Assisted Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs
    (android/arm64 only).
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html

is_lsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:21

    Compile for Leak Sanitizer to find leaks.

is_msan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:24

    Compile for Memory Sanitizer to find uninitialized reads.

is_nacl_glibc
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/nacl/config.gni:9

    Native Client supports both Newlib and Glibc C libraries where Newlib
    is assumed to be the default one; use this to determine whether Glibc
    is being used instead.

is_official_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:131

    Set to enable the official build level of optimization. This has nothing
    to do with branding, but enables an additional level of optimization above
    release (!is_debug). This might be better expressed as a tri-state
    (debug, release, official) but for historical reasons there are two
    separate flags.

is_perfetto_build_generator
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:82

    All the tools/gen_* scripts set this to true. This is mainly used to locate
    .gni files from //gn rather than //build.

is_perfetto_embedder
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:87

    This is for override via `gn args` (e.g. for tools/gen_xxx). Embedders
    based on GN (e.g. v8) should NOT set this and instead directly sets
    perfetto_build_with_embedder=true in their GN files.

is_tsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:27

    Compile for Thread Sanitizer to find threading bugs.

is_ubsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:31

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer to find various types of
    undefined behaviour (excludes vptr checks).

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:37

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's null pointer checks.

is_ubsan_security
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:87

    Enables core ubsan security features. Will later be removed once it matches
    is_ubsan.

is_ubsan_vptr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:40

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's vptr checks.

is_unsafe_developer_build
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:67

    Unsafe developer build. Has developer-friendly features that may weaken or
    disable security measures like sandboxing or ASLR.
    IMPORTANT: Unsafe developer builds should never be distributed to end users.

is_win_arm64
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:90

    Currently Windows on Arm doesn't support OpenGL or Vulkan.

ldso_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/gcc/BUILD.gn:20

libcxx_abi_unstable
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/BUILD.gn:18

    lldb pretty printing only works when libc++ is built in the __1 (or __ndk1)
    namespaces.  For pretty printing to work out-of-the-box on Mac (where lldb
    is primarily used), this flag is set to false to build with the __1
    namespace (to maintain ABI compatibility, this implies building without
    _LIBCPP_ABI_UNSTABLE).  This is not necessary on non-component builds
    because we leave the ABI version set to __1 in that case because libc++
    symbols are not exported.
    TODO(thomasanderson): Set this to true by default once rL352899 is available
    in MacOS's lldb.

libcxx_is_shared
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:55

    WARNING: Setting this to a non-default value is highly discouraged.
    If true, libc++ will be built as a shared library; otherwise libc++ will be
    linked statically. Setting this to something other than the default is
    unsupported and can be broken by libc++ rolls. Note that if this is set to
    true, you must also set libcxx_abi_unstable=false, which is bad for
    performance and memory use.

libcxx_natvis_include
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:30

    Builds libcxx Natvis into the symbols for type visualization.
    Set to false to workaround http://crbug.com/966676 and
    http://crbug.com/966687.

libcxx_svn_revision
    Current value (from the default) = "375504"
      From //buildtools/deps_revisions.gni:8

    The libc++ svn revision that belongs to the git hash in DEPS. Used to cause
    full rebuilds on libc++ rolls.

libyuv_disable_jpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:15

libyuv_include_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:14

libyuv_symbols_visible
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:19

    When building a shared library using a target in WebRTC or
    Chromium projects that depends on libyuv, setting this flag
    to true makes libyuv symbols visible inside that library.

libyuv_use_gflags
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:14

    Set to false to disable building with gflags.

libyuv_use_mmi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:22

libyuv_use_msa
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:20

libyuv_use_neon
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:17

link_pulseaudio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:44

    Allows distributions to link pulseaudio directly (DT_NEEDED) instead of
    using dlopen. This helps with automated detection of ABI mismatches and
    prevents silent errors.

llvm_force_head_revision
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:18

    If this is set to true, or if LLVM_FORCE_HEAD_REVISION is set to 1
    in the environment, we use the revision in the llvm repo to determine
    the CLANG_REVISION to use, instead of the version hard-coded into
    //tools/clang/scripts/update.py. This should only be used in
    conjunction with setting LLVM_FORCE_HEAD_REVISION in the
    environment when `gclient runhooks` is run as well.

mac_sdk_min
    Current value (from the default) = "10.15"
      From //build/config/mac/mac_sdk_overrides.gni:12

      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:77

    Limit the number of jobs (threads/processes) the linker is allowed
    to use (for linkers that support this).

media_use_ffmpeg
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:49

    Enable usage of FFmpeg within the media library. Used for most software
    based decoding, demuxing, and sometimes optimized FFTs. If disabled,
    implementors must provide their own demuxers and decoders.

media_use_libvpx
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:53

    Enable usage of libvpx within the media library. Used for software based
    decoding of VP9 and VP8A type content.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/mips.gni:13

    MIPS MultiMedia Instruction compilation flag.

mojo_media_host
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //media/media_options.gni:235

    The process that the mojo MediaService runs in. By default, all services
    registered in |mojo_media_services| are hosted in the MediaService, with the
    exception that when |enable_library_cdms| is true, the "cdm" service will
    run in a separate CdmService in the CDM (utility) process, while other
    |mojo_media_services| still run in the MediaService in the process specified
    by "mojo_media_host".
    Valid options are:
    - "browser": Use mojo media service hosted in the browser process.
    - "gpu": Use mojo media service hosted in the gpu process.
    - "utility": Use mojo media service hosted in the utility process.
    - "": Do not use mojo media service.

    A list of mojo media services that should be used in the media pipeline.
    Valid entries in the list are:
    - "renderer": Use mojo-based media Renderer service.
    - "cdm": Use mojo-based Content Decryption Module.
    - "audio_decoder": Use mojo-based audio decoder in the default media
                       Renderer. Cannot be used with the mojo Renderer above.
    - "video_decoder": Use mojo-based video decoder in the default media
                       Renderer. Cannot be used with the mojo Renderer above.

mojom_message_id_salt_path
    Current value (from the default) = "//chrome/VERSION"
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:110

    The path to a file whose contents can be used as the basis for a message
    ID scrambling salt.

mojom_message_id_salt_suffix_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:120

monolithic_binaries
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:200

    Only for local development. When true the binaries (perfetto, traced, ...)
    are monolithic and don't use a common shared library. This is mainly to
    avoid LD_LIBRARY_PATH dances when testing locally.

msan_track_origins
    Current value (from the default) = 2
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:45

    Track where uninitialized memory originates from. From fastest to slowest:
    0 - no tracking, 1 - track only the initial allocation site, 2 - track the
    chain of stores leading from allocation site to use site.

nacl_sdk_untrusted
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //native_client_sdk/src/BUILD.gn:14

    Build the nacl SDK untrusted components.  This is disabled by default since
    not all NaCl untrusted compilers are in goma (e.g arm-nacl-glibc)

ndk_api_level_at_least_26
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:69

needs_gomacc_path_arg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:14

    This flag is for ChromeOS compiler wrapper.
    By passing gomacc path via cmd-line arg, ChromeOS' compiler wrapper
    invokes gomacc inside it.

optimize_for_fuzzing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:95

    Optimize for coverage guided fuzzing (balance between speed and number of
    branches). Can be also used to remove non-determinism and other issues.

      From //ui/webui/webui_features.gni:11

    Optimize parts of Chrome's UI written with web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)
    for runtime performance purposes. This does more work at compile time for
    speed benefits at runtime (so we skip in debug builds).

ozone_auto_platforms
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/ozone/ozone.gni:16

    Select platforms automatically. Turn this off for manual control.

    Ozone extra platforms file path. Can be overridden to build out of
    tree ozone platforms.

ozone_platform
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //ui/ozone/ozone.gni:22

    The platform that will used at runtime by default. This can be overridden
    with the command line flag --ozone-platform=<platform>.

ozone_platform_cast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/ozone/ozone.gni:25

    Compile the 'cast' platform.

ozone_platform_gbm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/ozone/ozone.gni:28

    Compile the 'gbm' platform.

    1) When set to true, with a bundled FreeType, built from FreeType source
       code in //third_party/freetype and PDFium's FreeType configs in
       third_party/freetype/include.
    2) When set to false, use whatever FreeType target is defined in
       //build/config/freetype.

pdf_enable_click_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:19

    Generate logging messages for click events that reach PDFium

      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:54

    Build a complete static library

pdf_is_standalone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:51

    Build PDFium standalone

pdf_use_skia
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:41

    Build PDFium against Skia (experimental) rather than AGG. Use Skia to draw
    everything.

pdf_use_skia_paths
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:45

    Build PDFium against Skia (experimental) rather than AGG. Use Skia to draw
    paths.

      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:48

    Build PDFium with or without experimental win32 GDI APIs.

perfetto_build_with_android
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:78

    The Android blueprint file generator set this to true (as well as
    is_perfetto_build_generator). This is just about being built in the
    Android tree (AOSP and internal) and is NOT related with the target OS.
    In standalone Android builds and Chromium Android builds, this is false.

perfetto_force_dlog
    Current value (from the default) = "off"
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:205

    Whether DLOG should be enabled on debug builds (""), all builds ("on"), or
    none ("off"). We disable it by default for embedders to avoid spamming their
    console.

perfetto_use_system_protobuf
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:263

    Used by CrOS system builds. Uses the system version of protobuf
    from /usr/include instead of the hermetic one.

perfetto_verbose_logs_enabled
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:217

pgo_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:66

    Indicates if the build is using PGO.

pgo_data_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/pgo/pgo.gni:17

    When using chrome_pgo_phase = 2, read profile data from this path.

pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:33

    A pkg-config wrapper to call instead of trying to find and call the right
    pkg-config directly. Wrappers like this are common in cross-compilation
    environments.
    Leaving it blank defaults to searching PATH for 'pkg-config' and relying on
    the sysroot mechanism to find the right .pc files.

print_unsymbolized_stack_traces
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/third_party/symbolize/BUILD.gn:13

    Stack traces will not include function names. Instead they will contain
    file and offset information that can be used with
    tools/valgrind/asan/asan_symbolize.py. By piping stderr through this script,
    and also enabling symbol_level = 2, you can get much more detailed stack
    traces with file names and line numbers, even in non-ASAN builds.

proprietary_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:26

    Enables proprietary codecs and demuxers; e.g. H264, AAC, MP3, and MP4.
    We always build Google Chrome and Chromecast with proprietary codecs.
   
    Note: this flag is used by WebRTC which is DEPSed into Chrome. Moving it
    out of //build will require using the build_overrides directory.

root_extra_deps
    Current value (from the default) = []
      From //BUILD.gn:43

    A list of extra dependencies to add to the root target. This allows a
    checkout to add additional targets without explicitly changing any checked-
    in files.

rtc_audio_device_plays_sinus_tone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:169

    When set to true, replace the audio output with a sinus tone at 440Hz.
    The ADM will ask for audio data from WebRTC but instead of reading real
    audio samples from NetEQ, a sinus tone will be generated and replace the
    real audio samples.

rtc_build_examples
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:106

    Set this to false to skip building examples.

      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:222

rtc_build_with_neon
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:143

rtc_builtin_ssl_root_certificates
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:65

    Setting this to false will require the API user to pass in their own
    SSLCertificateVerifier to verify the certificates presented from a
    TLS-TURN server. In return disabling this saves around 100kb in the binary.

rtc_disable_check_msg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:264

    Set this to true to disable detailed error message and logging for
    RTC_CHECKs.

      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:267

    Set this to true to disable webrtc metrics.

rtc_disable_trace_events
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:260

    Set this to true to disable trace events.

rtc_enable_android_aaudio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:128

    Enable use of Android AAudio which requires Android SDK 26 or above and
    NDK r16 or above.

rtc_enable_avx2
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:247

    Set this to true to enable the avx2 support in webrtc.
    TODO(bugs.webrtc.org/11663): Default this to true and eventually remove.

rtc_enable_bwe_test_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:103

    Set this to true to enable BWE test logging.

rtc_enable_external_auth
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:93

    Enable when an external authentication mechanism is used for performing
    packet authentication for RTP packets instead of libsrtp.

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:213

    Set this to disable building with support for SCTP data channels.

rtc_enable_symbol_export
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:41

    Setting this to true will make RTC_EXPORT (see rtc_base/system/rtc_export.h)
    expand to code that will manage symbols visibility.

rtc_exclude_audio_processing_module
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:100

    Selects whether the audio processing module should be excluded.

rtc_exclude_field_trial_default
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:51

    When WebRTC is built as part of Chromium it should exclude the default
    implementation of field_trial unless it is building for NACL or
    Chromecast.

rtc_exclude_metrics_default
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:60

    Setting this to true will define WEBRTC_EXCLUDE_METRICS_DEFAULT which
    will tell the pre-processor to remove the default definition of symbols
    needed to use metrics. In that case a new implementation needs to be
    provided.

rtc_exclude_transient_suppressor
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:271

    Set this to true to exclude the transient suppressor in the audio processing
    module from the build.

rtc_include_builtin_audio_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:184

    When set to false, builtin audio encoder/decoder factories and all the
    audio codecs they depend on will not be included in libwebrtc.{a|lib}
    (they will still be included in libjingle_peerconnection_so.so and
    WebRTC.framework)

rtc_include_builtin_video_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:190

    When set to false, builtin video encoder/decoder factories and all the
    video codecs they depends on will not be included in libwebrtc.{a|lib}
    (they will still be included in libjingle_peerconnection_so.so and
    WebRTC.framework)

rtc_include_ilbc
    Current value = false
      From //.gn:47
    Overridden from the default = true

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:198

    When set to true and in a standalone build, it will undefine UNICODE and
    _UNICODE (which are always defined globally by the Chromium Windows
    toolchain).
    This is only needed for testing purposes, WebRTC wants to be sure it
    doesn't assume /DUNICODE and /D_UNICODE but that it explicitly uses
    wide character functions.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:45

    Android-only: Strip the debug info of libraries within lib.unstripped to
    reduce size. As long as symbol_level > 0, this will still allow stacks to be
    symbolized.

    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:40

    How many symbols to include in the build. This affects the performance of
    the build since the symbols are large and dealing with them is slow.
      2 means regular build with symbols.
      1 means minimal symbols, usually enough for backtraces only. Symbols with
    internal linkage (static functions or those in anonymous namespaces) may not
    appear when using this level.
      0 means no symbols.
      -1 means auto-set according to debug/release and platform.

    as part of the GYP_DEFINES provided by the CrOS emerge build or simple
    chrome build scheme. This variable permits controlling this for GN builds
    in similar fashion by setting the `system_libdir` variable in the build's
    args.gn file to 'lib' or 'lib64' as appropriate for the target architecture.

use_debug_fission
    Current value (from the default) = "default"
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:61

    use_debug_fission: whether to use split DWARF debug info
    files. This can reduce link time significantly, but is incompatible
    with some utilities such as icecc and ccache. Requires gold and
    gcc >= 4.8 or clang.
    http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission
   
    This is a placeholder value indicating that the code below should set
    the default.  This is necessary to delay the evaluation of the default
    value expression until after its input values such as use_gold have
    been set, e.g. by a toolchain_args() block.

use_dummy_lastchange
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/util/lastchange.gni:9

use_egl
    Current value (from the default) = true

use_official_google_api_keys
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:33

    You can set the variable 'use_official_google_api_keys' to true
    to use the Google-internal file containing official API keys
    for Google Chrome even in a developer build.  Setting this
    variable explicitly to true will cause your build to fail if the
    internal file is missing.
   
    The variable is documented here, but not handled in this file;
    see //google_apis/determine_use_official_keys.gypi for the
    implementation.
   
    Set the variable to false to not use the internal file, even when
    it exists in your checkout.
   
    Leave it unset or set to "" to have the variable
    implicitly set to true if you have
    src/google_apis/internal/google_chrome_api_keys.h in your
    checkout, and implicitly set to false if not.
   
    Note that official builds always behave as if the variable
    was explicitly set to true, i.e. they always use official keys,
    and will fail to build if the internal file is missing.

use_openh264
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/openh264/openh264_args.gni:11

use_rtti
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:69

    Build with C++ RTTI enabled. Chromium builds without RTTI by default,
    but some sanitizers are known to require it, like CFI diagnostics
    and UBsan variants.

use_sanitizer_configs_without_instrumentation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:113

    When enabled, only relevant sanitizer defines are set, but compilation
    happens with no extra flags. This is useful when in component build

      From //build/config/freetype/freetype.gni:13

    Blink needs a recent and properly build-configured FreeType version to
    support OpenType variations, color emoji and avoid security bugs. By default
    we ship and link such a version as part of Chrome. For distributions that
    prefer to keep linking to the version the system, FreeType must be newer
    than version 2.7.1 and have color bitmap support compiled in. WARNING:
    System FreeType configurations other than as described WILL INTRODUCE TEXT
    RENDERING AND SECURITY REGRESSIONS.

use_system_harfbuzz
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/harfbuzz-ng/harfbuzz.gni:11

    Blink uses a cutting-edge version of Harfbuzz; most Linux distros do not
    contain a new enough version of the code to work correctly. However,
    ChromeOS chroots (i.e, real ChromeOS builds for devices) do contain a
    new enough version of the library, and so this variable exists so that
    ChromeOS can build against the system lib and keep binary sizes smaller.

use_system_libsync
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libsync/BUILD.gn:13

    Controls whether the build should use the version of libsync
    library shipped with the system. In release builds of Chrome OS we
    use the system version, but when building on dev workstations we
    bundle it because Ubuntu doesn't ship a usable version.

use_system_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:14

    Controls whether the build should use the version of minigbm library shipped
    with the system. In release builds of desktop Linux and Chrome OS we use the
    system version.

use_system_xcode
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:60

    Use the system install of Xcode for tools like ibtool, libtool, etc.
    This does not affect the compiler. When this variable is false, targets will
    instead use a hermetic install of Xcode. [The hermetic install can be
    obtained with gclient sync after setting the environment variable
    FORCE_MAC_TOOLCHAIN for target_os mac only].

use_text_section_splitting
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:138

    This argument is to control whether enabling text section splitting in the
    final binary. When enabled, the separated text sections with prefix
    '.text.hot', '.text.unlikely', '.text.startup' and '.text.exit' will not be
    merged to '.text' section. This allows us to identify the hot code section
    ('.text.hot') in the binary which may be mlocked or mapped to huge page to
    reduce TLB misses which gives performance improvement on cpu usage.
    The gold linker by default has text section splitting enabled.

use_thin_lto
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:68

    Enables support for ThinLTO, which links 3x-10x faster than full LTO. See

    used for profile-guided optimization of builtins.
   
    To do profile-guided optimizations of builtins:
    1. Build with v8_enable_builtins_profiling = true
    2. Run your chosen workload with the --turbo-profiling-log-builtins flag.
       For Chrome, the invocation might look like this:

v8_target_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/v8_target_cpu.gni:33

    This arg is used when we want to tell the JIT-generating v8 code
    that we want to have it generate for an architecture that is different
    than the architecture that v8 will actually run on; we then run the
    code under an emulator. For example, we might run v8 on x86, but
    generate arm code and run that under emulation.
   
    This arg is defined here rather than in the v8 project because we want
    some of the common architecture-specific args (like arm_float_abi or
    mips_arch_variant) to be set to their defaults either if the current_cpu
    applies *or* if the v8_current_cpu applies.
   
    As described below, you can also specify the v8_target_cpu to use
    indirectly by specifying a `custom_toolchain` that contains v8_$cpu in the
    name after the normal toolchain.
   
    For example, `gn gen --args="custom_toolchain=...:clang_x64_v8_arm64"`
    is equivalent to setting --args=`v8_target_cpu="arm64"`. Setting
    `custom_toolchain` is more verbose but makes the toolchain that is
    (effectively) being used explicit.
   
    v8_target_cpu can only be used to target one architecture in a build,
    so if you wish to build multiple copies of v8 that are targeting
    different architectures, you will need to do something more
    complicated involving multiple toolchains along the lines of
    custom_toolchain, above.

win_console_app
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/console_app.gni:12

    If true, builds as a console app (rather than a windowed app), which allows
    logging to be printed to the user. This will cause a terminal window to pop
    up when the executable is not run from the command line, so should only be
    used for development. Only has an effect on Windows builds.

x64_arch

      From //build/config/x64.gni:16

    The micro architecture of x64 cpu. This will be a string like "haswell" or
    "skylake". An empty string means to use the default architecture which is
    "x86-64".
